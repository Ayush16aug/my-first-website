<p>We established our Shop on 30-november-2015, Riddhi Siddhi Saree, in 2015 with a focus on providing good quality and new variety of cloth to the people. For the past eight years, we have been working towards providing cloths to the people in towns and villages with good quality clothes at reasonable rates. Our mission is to make available cloths to people at lower rates. Over the past eight years, we have earned people's trust. We offer a wide variety of clothes such as sarees, lehengas, lanchas, men's suits, formals, kurtas, and pajamas at affordable prices. Our main aim is to make clothes available at lower rates than the market. </p>
